# resumeTemplate

## Purpose
* Train and showcase my competencies in HTML and CSS. 
* Enable full control of my resume's visual design
    * Specifically to enable an easy creation of a sidebar to highlight and visualize skills and skill levels

## Results and Reflections
* The resume looks good in printed form and on my primary screens
* The design breaks down when the screen gets very wide and for smaller screens - mobile view is unusable
    * A simple fix to the large-screen issue could be a hard limit to the allowed document width. This would also preserve the page's intended aspect ratio
    * Fixing the view for smaller screens would be through @media queries at specific break points.
    * The limitations are currently acceptable for this project, as I am mainly looking for something which prints nicely to a pdf file
* I have reinforced a lot of knowledge concerning HTML and CSS
* I have also learned some new things:
    * I've used Bootstrap icons and some of its basic classes
    * I've learned to dissect a Google Maps URL to pull the search query and add it to an anchor tag's href attribute
    * I've reinforced how to make an anchor tag send an email on click, and I've learned how to pre-fill the subject and text areas in that email.
    * I created progress bars in pure CSS and stored them as a separate css-file to be imported to the main style sheet
        * this saves over a screen of space in the style sheet and makes it easy to use the progress bars in other projects. Further, I can make the bars' progressions much more granular when I don't have to worry about the impact on readability in the main style sheet.

## Conclusion
I managed to create a resume which I believe presents well visually, and works well for the intended screen/page sizes. \
While there is obvious room for improvement in the CSS, I managed to finish the current version of the project with decent perceived time management, learned useful skills along the way, and have something which is usable in its current form.
